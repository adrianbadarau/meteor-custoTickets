At startup the app will create an admin users (admin@admin with a pass of admin) and a staff member (staff@staff with a pass of admin).

The staff member is able to manage departments, see, answer and delete all tickets.

Thanks to meteor cordova integration the app can easly be exported to Ios/Android platforms. I have cheked it on IOS 9 and it works perfectly.
